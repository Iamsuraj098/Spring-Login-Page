RedirectView in Spring MVC:

Redirect in Spring MVC is a mechanism that allows you to send a request to a different URL. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as when you need to send a user to a different page after they have submitted a form, or when you need to redirect a user to a different page based on their role.


0) HTTPServletResponse: Its a old method, here we make an object using "HTTPServletResponse response"
	-> response.sendRedirect("pass_url");

1) Redirect prefix: Refer to Recontroller.class file.
	-> By using Redirect prefix we can call another web page from current web page.
	-> Syntax: public String handler_name(){ 
					return "redirect:/url_name or url_path";
				}
	
2) RedirectView: Refer to Recontroller.class file.
	-> By using RedirectView we can call another web page from current web page.
	-> Here RedirectView is function which return RedirectView Object.
	-> Syntax: public RedirectView handler_name(){ 
					RedirectView redirectView = new RedirectView(); 
					redirect.serUrl("path_name"); 
					return redirectView;
				}
	-> Benefit of RedirectView over Redirect is by redirectView we can set URL of different web sites.
	
Use of Redirect or other method: 
1) In any case in form any input is blank then we redirect the same page by adding some detail.
2) In any case we want to go another site after adding data then use redirect.
